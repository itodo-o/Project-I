        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <!--<img src="5000.jpg">-->
        <p>Established in 1999, the founder of Eve's Garden, Ochanya Itodo, has always been passionate about addressing Climate Change, while also addressing the inequitability of the Climate justice conversation. She has a believe of having a holistic approach to climate justice. While Legislation and Policy is a significant part of defeating climate change, community work is an important part of Climate Justice. Eve's Garden is commited to working with and heping communities in need, through multiple events that seek to educate, assist, and also create dialouge. Our hope is that in our own ways, we can help create change. </p>

    <p>Eve's Garden Attempts to have programming year round. Our calander begins on Arbor Day, which is typically the Last Friday of April. Here at Eve's Garden, we have an Arbor Day celebration, where we plant trees in local parks, gardens, and urban areas. The neighborhoods we choose are based on empirical data and suggestions. Throughout the year, we have food banks, farmers markets in food deserts, and during the holidays, and we have community dinners <br>At Eve's Garden, we'll like to work with the community, so we have an open door policy at all of our locations and host townhalls to hear the needs of the people.<br>Furthermore, we partner with local schools to create class gardens and educate students on healthy eating habits and teach simple recipes to teach the family. We have programs that teach people how to start their own gardens, and what crops are good year round. </p>

        <h1>Our Political Work</h1>
        <p>Eve's Garden, depite the name, is a non-religious group that is open to people of all races, genders, sexualities, and people of all religious denomination and classes. Our concern is creating a world that all people can survive in regardless of their identities. <br>Eve's Garden believes that our government cares more about protecting corporate interest and companies than protecting our planet. We would like to change that. Eve's Garden has supported many bills that address Climate change, met up with Legislators, and have made a pledge that by 2050, all of our locations will run on renewable energy. We also work with global organizations, such as <a href="https://africanclimatefoundation.org/">The African Climate Foundation</a> to learn more about other organizations fights against climate change and how we can help. To learn more about our Political work, view our <a href="#">Political Action</a>page.</p>

    <section class="Vision">
        <h1>For the Future</h1>
        <p>As stated earlier, by 2050, all of Eve's Garden locations will use soley renewable energy. However, we have goals to fulfill before them. <br>Next Year, Eve's Garden will like to plant 3000 trees nationwide. Our Arbor Day celebration is big, but afterwords, our tree planting events have lower participantion. We will like to challenge ourselves. Furthermore, we will like to start building Arbitories for our community gardens. Bees are endangered and although they can be scary, these insects are great pollinators that are great for the environment. Another goal is to build a community greenhouse with an attached rain barrel. This are our main goals. To read more of our mission for 2022, check out our <a href="#">Events </a>page</p> or our <a href="#">2022 Goals</a> page. Also be sure to keep up with us on social media. If any of these goals speak to you, please fill out our<a href="#">volunteer form</a>.
