        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Created in 1999, Eve's Garden was concerned with what the world would look like in the new Millennium. Within the last century, big business and corporate greed has led to many environmental changes, including the warming of the Earth, as well as the extinction of many animals and lost of natural wonders. Experts project that if the Earth continues to warm, we will have more to lose than gain, including land, natural resources, and possibly our lives. Eve's Garden is not a religious group. However, just like Eve, we cannot gain back what was lost in paradise. However, we can try to maintain what we do have, so those long after us can celebrate a new Millennium. <br>Eve's Garden is a non- profit group. Our mission is not only to spread information, but also through social action. We create community gardens and maintain open spaces. Annually, we host an event where we plant trees in urban areas to combat Environmental Racism. Monthly, we host workshops on gardening tricks and tips, using plants that are native to the area and gro during that particular season. We works with pro-bono lawyers to create policies and lobby for Environmental bills and Earth scientist and Engineers to continue to do research. <br>Eve's Garden is a multi-faceted company and we are proud of the funding we recieve through grants, private donations, and from supporters like you! We hope, beginning next year, to start selling seeds to fund our many projects and operations, as well as to begin to build Apiaries, beehives for educational uses, for our partnering gardens and parks. <br> To learn more about what's happening at Eve's Garden...<br>
